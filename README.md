# Udacity-IPND743-Class
Intro to Programming IPND743

<h2> Notes, information and exercises for beginners </h3>

This repository's purpose is to provide notes, examples and things to play around with for people try to learn how to program
Currently, it has:

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ how to link stylesheets to your HTML document, instead of using the <style> element

<em>PLEASE</em> feel free to add notes, or just play around with things. I'd <strong>love</strong> to collaborate and share ideas with people.

<h2>Files</h2>
 I've included all sorts of HTML and CSS files in the repository to play with. Just Open them in your favorite code editor and play around!
Happy coding! :)
